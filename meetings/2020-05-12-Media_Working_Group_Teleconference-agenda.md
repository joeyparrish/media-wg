* [w3c/media-wg#13 TPAC F2F 2020](https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/issues/13) - mounirlamouri
> Should we meet at the TPAC F2F if it happens? For how long? Should we host a WebCodecs discussion?

* [w3c/picture-in-picture#172 Rename CSS pseudo-class :picture-in-picture](https://github.com/w3c/picture-in-picture/issues/172) - beaufortfrancois
> One way of thinking about the future of the Picture-in-Picture Web API is the ability to actually move an HTML element from a web page to a Picture-in-Picture window. In that case, the `:picture-in-picture` CSS pseudo-class name would be confusing for web developers as it would be hard to differentiate the web page element and the one in the Picture-in-Picture window.

* Autoplay API: update on API shape and editors

* [w3c/media-capabilities#152 Discuss how to reconcile colorGamut & transferFunction with ISO 23001-8:2016](https://github.com/w3c/media-capabilities/issues/152) - vi-dot-cpp
> Hi everyone. chcunningham@ and I would like to (re)open up discussion with respect to how MediaCapabilities.decodingInfo() should handle discrepancies between colorGamut & transferFunction input and and the color information implicit in mime types like VP9 and AV1. 
 >

* TextTrackCue: add optional event synchronisation https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5306
> A proposal to add recommended timing accuracy for TextTrackCue event synchronization (either as note or a 'should'): https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5306. With implementation changes to Chromium currently in progress, I think all major browser engines now achieve the recommended timing accuracy in practice.

* TextTrackCue: add unbounded duration https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5297
> A proposed change to allow TextTrackCues with unbounded duration: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5297
